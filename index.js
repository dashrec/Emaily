// We might have several different express applications. And so by calling Express like a function, it generates a new application that represents a running express app.
// By calling app DOT get by calling that function, we are creating a brand new Route handler.  that is watching for incoming HTTP requests with a very specific method.
// The arrow function is called automatically by express. Any time some request comes into this route, a forward slash or whatsoever.
// node is waiting for traffic to flow in  and then that traffic is routed onto express.
