// BrowserRouter tells react How to behave. It looks at the current URL and then changes the set of components that are visible on the screen at any given time.
// The route object is a react component that is used to set up a rule between a certain routes
// that the user might visit inside of an application and a set of components that will be actually visible on the screen.
